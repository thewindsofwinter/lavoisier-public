# lavoisier-public
Public-facing repository for a discord bot to serve USNCO problems. Currently, features are limited, but it is constantly being improved upon, and hopefully will get new updates throughout this year. Features to implement includes:

 - [ ] Create playlists of problems
 - [ ] Accept user input in terms of problem tagging, etc
 - [ ] Tag problems properly
 - [ ] Recreate statistics of past uses (easy, will be done soon)
